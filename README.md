Hi everyone! I'm Edmundo Mejia, a technical architect and a passionate about technology; I usually work building integrations and trying to find new approaches 
that I can leverage in my day-to-day activities. 

I'm a 9+ years Microsoft Dynamics AX programmer, and I also play around with Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Mixed Reality in my free time. 

I hope you find the content uploaded here useful for you!
