Hi everyone! I'm Edmundo Mejia, a senior technical architect and a passionate about technology; I usually work building integrations and trying to find new approaches that I can leverage in my day-to-day activities. 

I'm a 9+ years Microsoft Dynamics AX programmer, but I've also worked with Java, Android and .NET, among others. In my free time, I try to stay up date by building applications using Mixed Reality, Artifficial Intelligence, IoT and Cognitive Services.

I hope you find the content uploaded here useful for you!
