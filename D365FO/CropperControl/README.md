Cropper control is a D365 Extensible Control create for demonstration purposes that allows for a user to load an image in a JavaScript cropping canvas. Once cropped, the new image can be uploaded as an attachment linked to the selected customer.

This control has been created using the Microsoft Extensibility Framework along with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

For this demo, open source cropperjs library was used. More details on such library: https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/.
