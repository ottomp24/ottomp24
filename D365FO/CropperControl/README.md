## Overview

**Cropper control** is a D365 Extensible Control created for demonstration purposes that allows for a user to load an image in a JavaScript cropping canvas. Once cropped, the new image can be uploaded as an attachment linked to the selected customer.

This control has been created using the Microsoft Extensibility Framework along with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Go to Visual Studio > Dynamic D365 > Import Project...
1. Select the .AXPP file and hit OK.

Files can also be extracted from the .AXPP file by just changing the file extension to .ZIP if needed.

## Notes

For this demo, open source cropperjs library was used. More details: https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/. 
No modifications were made to such library and it's only used to demonstrate how Extensible Controls work fine with any JavaScript library. All rights belongs to the owner only.
